          <h1>Rhinobird Privacy Policy</h1>
          <p><em>Effective date: February 9th 2015</em></p>
          <p>Here at Rhinobird, we are committed to preserving your privacy and being transparent about how Rhinobird uses information collected through its Rhinobird website and related services (the "Rhinobird Services"). The following privacy policy is intended to inform you of our policies and procedures regarding the information we collect and use when you use the Rhinobird Services.</p>
          <h2>Information Collected By Rhinobird</h2>
          <p>When you use the Rhinobird Services, we may collect the following information:</p>
          <p><em>Information You Provide</em>: When you use the Rhinobird Services you will have the opportunity to provide us with some information directly. For example, some functions of the Rhinobird Services require the user to register an account, and the registration process requires your name, e-mail address, and your selected username. Except as described below, this information will be kept private, unless you set your privacy settings to disclose this information on your profile</p>
          <p>Certain parts of the Rhinobird Services also allow you to upload or post content to the Rhinobird platform ("User Content"). You may post User Content at your sole discretion, but please note that any User Content you post may be publicly available, viewable to others, and may appear in search results of third-party search engines. Rhinobird recommends that you do not post any sensitive personal information, such as your address, information about website accounts, credit card numbers, or your Social Security Number, as that information may be seen by others.</p>
          <p>When you upload User Content, Rhinobird gives you the option of recording geographical location information, which Rhinobird retrieves from your device. Rhinobird uses this information to improve its services and may share this information with others. If you do not wish to share your location you can disable location information when you begin recording, or disable sharing of geographical location information on your device</p>
          <p><em>Information Provided By Third-Party Services You Use</em>: Rhinobird gives you the option to sign up for the Rhinobird Services using certain third-party social media accounts, including Facebook, Twitter, and Google. If you sign up or log in to the Rhinobird Services using a third-party service, that service will share certain information with Rhinobird. What information they share is governed by the service's terms of use and privacy policy.</p>
          <p><em>Automatically Collected Information</em>: As with most services, when you access and use the Rhinobird Services, we may automatically record certain types of information, even if you are not logged in. This information may include your IP address, the content and pages that you access, and the dates and times of your access. We may also collect information about the software you use to connect to the Rhinobird Services, as well as information about the geographic location from which you are accessing the Rhinobird Services.</p>
          <p>Rhinobird may also use "cookies" or other automated mechanisms to collect information and personalize your service. Cookies are small files that services like Rhinobird can send to your browser for storage on your computer. They make use of the Services easier to navigate by saving preferences, remembering your login information, and recalling other aspects of your use of the service. While most browsers allow you to disable cookies, we recommend that you leave cookies enabled so as not to interfere with the full functionality of the Rhinobird Services.</p>
          <h2>Use of Collected Information</h2>
          <p>The information we collect is used to operate and maintain the Rhinobird Services. As you can see from using the Rhinobird Services, certain information you provide us will be visible to the public, including your username and User Content. Be aware when selecting a username that the name you choose will be shared with the public.</p>
          <p>We may also use your e-mail address to communicate with you about your account, and/or to inform you of changes to the Rhinobird Services.</p>
          <p>The automatically collected information described above may also be used to personalize your experience, facilitate certain functions on the Rhinobird Services, and track user trends and preferences so as to identify potential improvements to the platform. Rhinobird delivers some of its features through use of peer-to-peer content delivery systems, which coordinate content delivery between multiple computers and may share some automatically collected information as part of that process.</p>
          <p>Rhinobird reserves the right to retain data and content for archival, restorative, or research purposes. If you delete your account or any User Content, Rhinobird will immediately disable public access to the information and will promptly delete that information from Rhinobird?s servers. Please note that some User Content, including content used as part of Rhinobird's research, promotion, or analysis of the Rhinobird Services, may still be preserved.</p>
          <h2>Sharing of Collected Information with Third Parties</h2>
          <p>Except as set forth in this policy, Rhinobird does not share user information with third parties without your consent. Nevertheless, some amount of sharing is necessary in order for Rhinobird to provide the Rhinobird Services. The following individuals or entities may have access to user information.</p>
          <p><em>Rhinobird Staff</em>: Members of the Rhinobird team may have access to user information as necessary for the operation of the Rhinobird Services.</p>
          <p><em>Third Party Service Providers</em>: Rhinobird may work with third-party service providers in order to research, operate, or improve the Rhinobird Services, and may share user Information with its third party service providers solely as is needed for those third party service providers to provide services to Rhinobird.</p>
          <p><em>Business Transfers</em>: If Rhinobird is acquired by another company, goes into dissolution, or otherwise sells or transfers its assets to another company, Rhinobird will transfer any user information in its possession to the other company as part of this transaction.</p>
          <p><em>Legal Compliance</em>: We may share user information when we believe in good faith that release is necessary to comply with a governmental or court order; to comply with applicable law; to comply with a subpoena from a third party; or to protect the rights, property, or safety of Rhinobird, our employees, our users, or others. Rhinobird cares about your legal right to disseminate information anonymously; if we receive a subpoena from a third party that requests your account information or other identifying information, we will attempt to provide you with advance warning to the extent possible under the terms of the subpoena, in case you would like to challenge that request.</p>
          <p><em>Data Analysis</em>: Rhinobird may use, transfer, sell, and share aggregated, anonymous data derived from User Information for any business purpose, including for purposes of analyzing usage trends and seeking compatible advertisers and partners. This data will not include any personally identifiable information.</p>
